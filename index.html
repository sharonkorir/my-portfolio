        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a software development student at Moringa School. I have a background in Architecture. I joined Moringa School because I believe that technology is at the forefront of every industry. Given the digital nature of architecture and design today, learning to code is an essential skill for the architect. As an architect, learning to code will help me expand my capabilities and drive my skills to new heights.</p>
        <h2>Educational background</h2>
        <p>I completed my Kenya Certificate of Secondary School Education in 2014. I joined the Univversity of Nairobi for my Bachelor of Architecture degree which I attained in 2021.</p>
        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy reading novels, traveling, outdoor activities and hiking.I like trying new things because I don't know what I can't do yet. I am a formula one enthusiast.</p>
